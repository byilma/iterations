## Lists - you can put anything in a list
```{r}
l  = list (
  vec_numeric = 5:8,
vec_logical = c(T,T,F,T, F, F),
nat = matrix(1:8, nrow = 2, ncol = 4),
summary = summary(rnorm(100))
)

```


```{r}
l %>% View()
l$vec_numeric
l[[1]]

l[["vec_numeric"]][1:3]

l[["vec_numeric"]][1:3] %>% mean()
```


## `for` loop

create a new list 

```{r}

list_norm =
  list(
    a = rnorm(20, mean =3, sd =1),
     b = rnorm(30, mean =0, sd =5),
     c = rnorm(40, mean =10, sd =.2),
     d = rnorm(20, mean =-3, sd =1)
  )

```


```{r}
list_norm
list_norm[[1]]
```

Pause & get our old function. 

```{r}

```
